This is my PEDUMP code as January 1998.  It's certainly better than the original
PEDUMP from my MSJ column, and from my "Windows 95 System Programming Secrets"
book.  There are additions for several new file types, and additional resources.

Having said that, this is by no means the best PEDUMP sources I have.  I've made
extensive additions since then for things like PE32+ (Win64) support.  I plan to
release them publicly as part of future article in MSDN magazine.   This article
will essentially be an update of my 1994 article on the PE format.  There have
been many exciting changes since then, and I'll cover them, as well as correct
some errors in the original.

In the meanwhile, enjoy this code.  I know there are some bugs in a few places.
(Yes, I know that there is a new .LIB file format, for instance.)  These issues
are  most likely fixed in the version I have locally.  Comments are welcome,
but I don't expect to actively work on this branch of my PEDUMP code.

You can build the sources with the enclosed PEDUMP.MAK file.
